## Description
The completion of this project involved developing a Node.js command-line application designed to create custom logos based on user input. This application is interactive, prompting users to make selections and input data that define the appearance of their logo. Key options include choosing a color, selecting a shape, and providing specific text to be included in the logo design.

Once the user inputs these details, the application utilizes Node.js capabilities to generate a logo conforming to the specified parameters. The final output is an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file, offering high-quality, scalable imagery suitable for various applications. The ability to save the logo as an SVG file ensures that the graphics remain sharp and clear at any size, making it ideal for branding and promotional purposes.
